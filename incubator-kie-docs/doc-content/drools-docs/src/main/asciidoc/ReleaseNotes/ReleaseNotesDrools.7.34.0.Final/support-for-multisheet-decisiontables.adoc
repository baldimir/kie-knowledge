= Support for multisheet decisiontables

By default only the first worksheet of a decision table is taken in count to be translated into rules. It is now possible
to override this defualt by creating a _.properties_ file with the same name of the file containing the decision tables
(e.g.: if your decision tables are in a file name _DTables.xls_ create in the same folder another file named _DTables.xls.properties_)
and adding a property _sheets_ to it with a comma separeted list of the names of the worksheets that you want to be processed
by the rule engine as in the following example.

```
sheets=Sheet1,Sheet2
```

Incremental compilation will also take count of this _.properties_ file accordingly.
